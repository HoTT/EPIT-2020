# EPIT-2020

[EPIT 2020 - Spring School on Homotopy Type Theory](https://epit2020cnrs.inria.fr) course materials and planning.

Course units are organized into folders:

* [Introduction to homotopy type theory](./01-introduction-to-hott)
* [The Coq-HoTT library](./02-Coq-HoTT)
* [Models of Homotopy Type Theory](./03-simplicial-and-cubical-models)
* [Cubical Type Theory and Cubical Agda](./04-cubical-type-theory)
* [Synthetic Homotopy Theory](./05-synthetic-homotopy-theory)

We will also have two shorter lectures on:

  * The Arend Proof Assistant by Valery Isaev
  * Directed Homotopy Type Theory by Paige North

**The program of the week will be lectures/exercise sessions from 2pm to 6.30pm (UTC+2). We will organize virtual social events in the evening.**

The lectures will be streamed and recordings of them will be made available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjJu7eXFuKwIp5W6pxeMsBQ).
