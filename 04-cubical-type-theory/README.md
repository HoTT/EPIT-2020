# Cubical Type Theory and Cubical Agda

Lecturer: [Anders Mörtberg](https://staff.math.su.se/anders.mortberg/)

Teaching assistants for the exercise session:

- [Axel Ljungström](https://www.su.se/english/profiles/axlj4439-1.450268)
- [Evan Cavallo](https://staff.math.su.se/evan.cavallo/)
- [Loïc Pujet](https://pujet.fr/)
- [Max Zeuner](https://www.su.se/english/profiles/maze1512-1.450461)
- [Maximilian Dore](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/maximilian.dore)

## Background material

Participants are encouraged to look at the following material before
the course starts:

- Video recording of
  [Every proof assistant: Cubical Agda](https://vimeo.com/459020971)

- Section 2 of the papers
  [Cubical Agda: A Dependently Typed Programming Language with Univalence and Higher Inductive Types](https://staff.math.su.se/anders.mortberg/papers/cubicalagda2.pdf) and [Internalizing Representation Independence with Univalence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05547)

It is not necessary to actually learn or understand all of the above
material and we will not assume that everyone has looked at it.
However, at least taking a look at it will definitely help with
following the course and many of the examples will be taken from the
above sources.

The lecture notes
[Cubical Methods in Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations](https://staff.math.su.se/anders.mortberg/papers/cubicalmethods.pdf)
from the
[2019 HoTT summer school](https://hott.github.io/HoTT-2019//summer-school/)
might also be useful for some participants, but they assume quite a
bit of mathematics and do not discuss Cubical Agda.

## Installation of Cubical Agda and agda/cubical

In order to follow the course one needs a recent release of Agda
(version >=2.6.1): https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/Main/Download

One also needs to download and build v0.2 of the agda/cubical library:
https://github.com/agda/cubical/releases/tag/v0.2

If one has installed Agda and have the `agda` executable in ones path
then building the library should work by running `make` in the
cubical-0.2 directory after unpacking the v0.2 package. If one wants
to use the agda/cubical library in another directory one has to
register it by following:
https://github.com/agda/cubical/blob/master/INSTALL.md#registering-the-cubical-library

Students with the intention to contribute to or trying out the latest
version of the agda/cubical library will need to install the development version
of Agda. Detailed instructions can be found at: https://github.com/agda/cubical/blob/master/INSTALL.md

**Tip**: It can be a bit complicated to install the development version
of Agda and Anders uses the "cabal sandbox install instructions" solution,
but other solutions might work better on other systems.

If you run into problems with installing Agda on your system you're welcome
to ask for help on #tech-desk on Discord.

## Schedule

*Everything below is under construction. The final version of
the material and exercises will be uploaded the same day as the course
is given, but I intend to develop the material here on Github.*

The online lectures will take place on Thursday, April 15, 2021.
All times are in UTC+2 (i.e. Stockholm time).

## Contents

### Part 1: Introduction

* Why Cubical Type Theory?
* Cubical Agda demo

### Part 2: The interval and path types

* The interval in Cubical Agda
* `Path` and `PathP` types
* Function extensionality
* Equality in Σ-types

### Part 3: Transport and composition

* Cubical `transport`
* Subst as a special case of cubical `transport`
* Path induction from `subst`?
* Homogeneous composition (`hcomp`)
* Binary composition of paths as special case of `hcomp`

### Part 4: Univalence and the SIP

* Univalence from `ua` and `uaβ`
* Transporting with `ua` (examples: `ua not : Bool = Bool`, `ua suc : Z = Z`, ...)
* Subst using `ua`
* The SIP as a consequence of `ua`
* Examples of using the SIP for math and programming (algebra, data structures, etc.)

### Part 5: Higher inductive types

* Quotients via HITs
* Propositional truncation for logic?
* CS example using quotients (maybe finite multisets or queues)
* Synthetic homotopy theory (probably `Torus = S^1 * S^1`, `pi_1(S^1) = Z`, `pi_1(Torus) = Z * Z`)

### Exercises

*TODO*

## Additional material

Here are some pointers to further reading about Cubical Agda and
examples of programming and proving in cubical type theory:

- [Cubical Agda: A dependently typed programming language with univalence and higher inductive types](https://staff.math.su.se/anders.mortberg/papers/cubicalagda2.pdf) - The paper about Cubical Agda. Contains quite a few examples and explains how the system is implemented.
- [Internalizing Representation Independence with Univalence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05547) - Paper about proving representation independence results in Cubical Agda. This paper contains examples of reasoning cubically about datastructures and other CS examples.
- [Cubical Synthetic Homotopy Theory](https://staff.math.su.se/anders.mortberg/papers/cubicalsynthetic.pdf) and [Synthetic Cohomology Theory in Cubical Agda](https://staff.math.su.se/anders.mortberg/papers/zcohomology.pdf) - Synthetic algebraic topology in Cubical Agda. These papers contain various results from HoTT ported to Cubical Agda which led to some proofs becoming substantially shorter. There are also some new constructions and computations which rely on univalence and HITs not being axiomatic.
- [Three Equivalent Ordinal Notation Systems in Cubical Agda](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10759) - Some classical proof theory and ordinals in Cubical Agda.
- [Congruence Closure in Cubical Type Theory](https://hott-uf.github.io/2020/HoTTUF_2020_paper_16.pdf) - A nice application of Path types to congruence closure algorithms.
- [Formalizing 𝜋-calculus in Guarded Cubical Agda](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3372885.3373814) - formalization of the 𝜋-calculus in an extension of Cubical Agda.
- [Cubical Methods in Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations](https://staff.math.su.se/anders.mortberg/papers/cubicalmethods.pdf) - Lecture notes for the 2019 HoTT Summer School. The focus is more on cubical models and not so much on practical formalization in cubical type theory. Contains exercises and lots of background material. The reference list is quite extensive and contains pointers to further material and important papers (a lot of them aimed at experts).
